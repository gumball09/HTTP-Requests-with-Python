1) GET VS. HEAD REQUESTS
- GET: to obtain information/content of a particular URL
- HEAD: to obtain metadata of the URL, not the content (these metadata resides in the headers)

/* SOLUTION */
- Similarities:
    + Headers returned by both requests are IDENTICAL
    + Both are idempotent operations, causing no changes in the server

- Differences:
    + Response to a HEAD request does not have a body
    + HEAD is meant to be used to get METADATA for a resource (format, size, user-agent, content-type)

2) PUT VS. DELETE
- PUT: Make changes to existing resources by overwritting previous values with current ones
- DELETE: Remove resources from the server

/* SOLUTION */
- PUT:
    + Create or replaces a value/ resource at the target
    + Is idempotent, either create a resource not exist or entirely replace existing resource
    + If called many times, the same affect will take place on the same resource
 
- DELETE:
    + Delete a file or resource at specified URL endpoint

3) VIEW REDIRECT HISTORY
- GET REQUEST
    response = requests.get(<url>, <options>
- REDIRECT HISTORY (A LIST OF REDIRECTS)
    response.history
